# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project simulates credit card transaction data with imbalanced fraud cases, then trains multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for binary fraud classification. It includes PCA visualization and a full ML pipeline with SMOTE balancing and hyperparameter tuning.

- `notebooks/` : Exploratory data analysis and visualization notebooks  
- `src/` : Python scripts for data generation and modeling  
- `requirements.txt` : Lists all Python dependencies  

## How to Run
